# Personal-Codes
These are codes that I created to make my life easier :D

1.Anime Checker was a code that I made to check if I downloaded all the anime episodes for certain anime. 
  If the detects that I have some missing, then it will tell me which episodes that I am missing.
  This code be used for other things also such as making all of the files from work, school are there.
